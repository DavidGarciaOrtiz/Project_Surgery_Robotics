# **Surgery Robotics Project setup**

The objectives of this section are:
- Setup the project in student's github
- Review the needed tools
- Update and syncronize the repository project

## **1. Setup the project in student's github**

When working in Laboratory groups, we suggest you:
- One student plays the role of `Director`. This student makes a "Fork" of the Professor's github project.
- The `Director` accept the other students as `Collaborators`

- Then the `Collaborators` will make a "fork" of the `Director`'s github project.
- The `Collaborators` will be able to update the github `Director`'s project and participate on the project generation

To work on the project (during lab sessions or for homework at home), the `Director` or `Collaborators` have to clone the `Director`'s github project in Visual Studio Code local environment.
- Open VScode on lab's PC, go to Desktop folder and clone the `Director`'s github project.

- In VScode open the folder you have cloned to work on the project

- You can work on the project and add/modify any files of the project.


## **2. Review the needed tools**

You will need to use:
- Visual Studio Code with extensions:
  - Python Extension Pack
  - Git Extension Pack
  - "Arduino Community Edition" (vscode-arduino)
- roboDK

To proceed with Arduino uploading program, follow instructions in:

## **3. Update and syncronize the repository project**

When working on a Laboratory project, the objective at the end of a Lab session is to update the changes you have made. 

This can be made either by the `Director` of the Lab group or by any other `Collaborator` following the procedure:
- Either the `Director`or the `Collaborators`have to be sure they are connected to their Github Account. 
  - Click on Accounts in Black left bar
  - Select "Backup and Sync settings..."
  - Select "Sign in"
  - Choose your GitHub account
- To syncronize the changes you have made and update the github origin repository:
  - Select "Source control" from Black left bar
  - Add all changes
  - type a Message
  - select "Sync"

The `Project-Director` github repository has been updated!
